# GSTR
Calculate genotype-specific treatment response based on Li et al paper. https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/81/17/4570/670285/Quantitative-In-Vivo-Analyses-Reveal-a-Complex. The method in the paper assumes all tumors are uniformly shrunk by S by the treatment. This module focuses GxE interaction. By using the adjusted cutoff L x S in the treated group and cutoff L in the untreated group, it tries to quanity GSTR by comparing the observed tumor size distribution of a genotype post treatment with the expected distribution from the untreated mice. 95% percentile interval and p-values are calculated by bootstrapping.
